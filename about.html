        <h2>Chasing The Dream</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 font-w-4">
          I was enamored with the thought of spending my every moment of life drifting in the clouds. In Aug. 2011, I went to Purdue to pursue a B.S. in Professional Flight Technology. At the same time, I enrolled in the Airforce ROTC and joined the Arnold Air Society. This was the first turning point in my life - I learned key skills that I will carry for the rest of my life.

        <h2>Flying Solo</h2>
        <p  class="mb-4 font-w-4">
          I completed my first long solo flight from West Lafayette, IN to Traverse City, MI. It was both a milestone and a marvel in so many ways. Sometime during my return flight, I felt very, very cold inside the cabin even though I had the heater on. Turns out, I left the passenger door open! It’s like when you don’t close your car door all the way, it’s sort of in a semi-closed position. To make matters more interesting, I couldn’t even close the door because the force of the air was simply too strong while flying at 8,500ft. Had to make a detour at an airport of my choosing just to close the door. What a time...

        <h2>The Dream Ended</h2>
        <p  class="mb-4 font-w-4">
          I loved flying. I really did. But I knew that if I made my career out of passion alone, I would end up hating both my career and my passion. In 2013, the FAA issued a new guidance that the ATP license (the license to fly commercial jets) would require 1,500 flight hours, up from 250. My program at the time was designed so that students would graduate with around 300 hours, was simply not enough for this new requirement. I would have to grind my additional 1,200 flight hours out of my own capital or find some other flying jobs that would be highly competitive and saturated at time of my graduation. All of a sudden, I felt like I was behind and there was nothing I could do. So, I made the decision to drop Professional Flight Technology and pursue the other majors that I already made progress in: Management Information Systems, Accounting, and Finance (yes, I was quad major once).

        <h2>A New Begining</h2>
        <p  class="mb-4 font-w-4">
          My first internship was with Air Liquide, in Houston, TX in the summer of 2014. As a native Californian, I thought I would just rent a place 1.5 miles away and walk to and from work every day. Let’s just say that it did not go well at all. The internship itself was also a huge lesson-learned on my part: my heart was, is, and will always be with technology. Afterall, I did grow up a few hundred yards away from early Apple and Steve Jobs, on the intersection of Bradley Dr and Alves Ave in Cupertino, CA. I guess innovation is contagious.

        <h2>Pursuit of Hope</h2>
        <p  class="mb-4 font-w-4">
          Graduation! Turns out I was pretty good at MIS, Accounting, and Finance, so I graduated with all 3. Having had 3 majors, I didn't even need to pursue a Masters in Accounting to sit for the California CPA exam. So, I spend 10 hours a day, from dawn to dusk at Starbucks, studying for the CPA exam that summer. I was fortunate to land a job as a financial statement auditor back in the Bay Area at Crowe, LLP (at the time, it was Crowe Horwath, LLP) in the heart of San Francisco. Like I said, innovation is contagious. I was, in my opinion, not a good auditor. I was the type of auditor who would spend 10 hours learning to automate the 5 hours of manual work that I did not want to do. I was literally stress testing the tools and capabilities at the firm to find the most efficient and effortless ways to do my job. That’s how I got my kicks.

        <h2>Finding the Ones</h2>
        <p  class="mb-4 font-w-4">
          Since a few months before this point, I was studying approximately 10 hours a week on SQL and Python, and built a website on the side with a friend. Admittedly, I wasn’t very good at building websites, but it was fun. Perhaps it was fate that Yao Yang and Shan Huang, my managers and mentors at EY, brought me onboard in June of 2017 as a Data Specialist. There, I learned the tools of the trade - big data processing, ETL, team management, and much more. It was at EY that I felt like the stars aligned and I was finally moving forward towards my calling. That team was my home.

          Like every child growing up, it was time for me to move on. At Uber, I felt like every opportunity has been made available: I was doing data analytics in a high-profile tech company in the center of the technology hub of the world. I got to do data analysis and automation with the freedom and tools of my choosing. What mattered was, make an impact.

        <p  class="mb-4 font-w-4">
          This was my first conference, DataEDGE’19 at UC Berkeley, and sneak peek into who data scientists are and what they do. I loved every second of it. I loved hearing the problems that they were solving, and how they solved those problems. I loved hearing about the algorithms that I could barely understand and the impacts that I wouldn’t have believed. It’s hard to draw a line for the day that I decided to step foot into data science, but this day is definitely a contender.

          I was fully immersed for two days among UberAI, Uber Labs and Uber ATG. They demonstrated the potential to solve business problems with what seemed like dark-art. By the end of the UberML’19 conference, I knew that data science and machine learning is my calling. It felt like the word “innovation” has been stamped on every cell in my body. I’ve seen too much already. Nothing is stopping me now.

        <p  class="mb-4 font-w-4">
          Between the end of 2019 and 2020, I knew that I wanted to accelerate my career growth into data science and machine learning. The announcement of a data science manager’s joining Internal Audit to lead my team, however, changed my career trajectory. His leadership would undoubtedly elevate my team to new heights. He had built a data science team before from scratch, and we knew he could do it again. Regrettably, his untimely departure 1 month later derailed my plans for up to 2 years. I felt betrayed. I was angry and afraid. At around the same time, I also lost friends and trusted colleagues to the layoff. Uber lost our AI Labs and AI orgs. It seemed that my career at Uber was coming to a screeching halt. Mid-2020 was a dark time. But, William Hollis reminded me that, “I didn’t come this far, to only come this far”. So I kept fighting.

          Since mid 2020, I had been working on my first applied research in machine learning. To me, this project is my legacy at Uber. If I ever look back at my time at Uber, I want to proudly say, “I made an impact.” So, no guidance? No problem. I’d either figure it out on my own or find mentors who would help me. From research to design to implementation to release, I owned this project. March 2, 2021 was the big reveal of my work to the world: my paper was reviewed and published on Uber Engineering Blog. This was a huge step for me and my team.
